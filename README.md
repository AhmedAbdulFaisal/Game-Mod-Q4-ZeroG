# Game-Mod-Q4-ZeroG
IT Game Mod class project - Zero G Mod

Here is my full 'Zero G' mod project for Quake 4. The mod itself is a zero-gravity Quake Mod where you can move around in a weightless environment.

Gameplay:

Moving in Zero G is done by two commands:

Move up (Must be on the ground): Spacebar
Move down (Must be crouching): Crouch

Both these moves take up fuel, which is shown in the top left. The player can move around vertically in the air for as long as they want until 
they run out of fuel by doing the aforementioned actions. When the player runs out of fuel, they can't move whatsoever and must refuel themselves with haste powerups.

Besides the main deliverable, the mod has other features, such as:

* An aforementioned HUD meter showing fuel
* A custom shortcut which autolaunches into the mod
* Custom Menu Screen
* Custom 'about' screen showing custom artwork and GUI work
